    "title": "Welcome to Prosocial Tech Collab :)",
    "body": "The goal of Prosocial Tech Collab (PTC) is to provide a dedicated space for people to find collaborators for projects related to prosocial tech, as well as to foster community and resource sharing.\n\nWe support builders of prosocial tech, as well as researchers, journalists, artists, and community organizers who are working on projects that advance the goals of prosocial technology.",

      "title": "What is Prosocial Technology?",
      "body": "Prosocial technologies are digital tools, platforms, and systems that have been intentionally designed to promote positive social behaviors and enhance collective wellbeing.\n\nHow prosocial a technology is depends on both its design choices and the market incentives behind it — market incentives are what drive design practices that maximize engagement and profit, even when they come at the expense of user well-being.\n\nFor this reason, we focus on supporting projects that not only apply prosocial design principles, but adopt business practices that are sustainable and non-exploitative.\n\nNot sure if your project is prosocial? This chart from Lisa Schirch and the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, the Council on Technology and Social Cohesion, and the Toda Peace Institute is a great reference:",
